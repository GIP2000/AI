1. Install Rust
    - Install Rustup (Linux / Macos)
        - `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
        - run `cargo --version` to ensure rust is installed properly
2. Download code.
    - `git clone https://github.com/GIP2000/AI.git`


# Usage <a name="Usage"/>
1. `cd` into the `neural_network` directory
2. `cargo run --bin train` will run the trainig sequence.
3. `cargo run --bin test` will run the testing sequence.
4. `cargo run --bin setup_new` will initalize weights with the specified size
5. `cargo run --bin generate_spirals` will make a new spiral file
    - This will make a randmoized spiral for evaluation of my program I will supply you with the dataset I used.

## Spirals Dataset Generation

A classic starter problem for machine learning is classifyling to spirals. This dataset requires that two spirals are generated and their (x,y) along with which spiral they belong to. I generated the spirals from scratch by creating a vector of unifromly distributed random radii with the length of the amount of points I wanted to generate. Then each x cordinate was calulated by $x = r*cos(r) + \mu $ and $y = r*sin(r) + \mu$ where $\mu$ is a random 0 mean and .02 sigma random variable. This was done twice however the second time the second time the x and y formula's were multiplyed by -1 making $x = -r*cos(r) + \mu$ and $y = -r*sin(r) + \mu$. Then I shuffled both lists and collected 80% for training and left 20% for testing.

## Neural Network
The shape of my network was 2 256 1. There are two inputs (the x and y coordinates). I chose 256 hidden layers, and the output layers is one since it is a Binary Classifier.
I trained the neural network for 10,000 epochs with a learning rate of .001. (Note this took 3 hours, I tried it with 5,000 epochs and it didn't break 90% accuracy)

## Results

The results file contains the results as follows:
```588 0 8 604  0.993 1.000 0.987 0.993
0.993 1.000 0.987 0.993
0.993 1.000 0.987 0.993
```

This means that there is an accuracy of 93% ,100% percision, 98% recall, and 99% f1 score.
Overall the Neural Network is capaable of determinging with great accuracy which of the two trained of spirals that it trained on a point belongs to.
This does not mean that this network will be able to given two random spirals differentiate between them. It also is not a given that outside the domain and range of the training set that it would be able to continue the trend and determine spirals outside of its trained range if the spirals were to continue.
